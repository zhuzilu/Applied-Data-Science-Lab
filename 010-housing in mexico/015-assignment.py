# In this assignment, you'll work with a dataset of homes for sale in Brazil. 
# Your goal is to determine if there are regional differences in the real estate 
# market. Also, you will look at southern Brazil to see if there is a relationship 
# between home size and price, similar to what you saw with housing in 
# some states in Mexico.
