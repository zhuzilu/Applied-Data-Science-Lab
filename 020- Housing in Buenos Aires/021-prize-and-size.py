#In this project, you're working for a client who wants to create a model that can predict the price of apartments in the city of Buenos Aires â€” with a focus on apartments that cost less than $400,000 USD.

# Steps: 1. Prepare Data. 2. Build Model. 3. Communicate Results

# 1. PREPARE DATA

# 1.1 Import

# Make a function to clean up the data
#Task 2.1.1: Write a function named wrangle that takes a file path as an argument and returns a DataFrame.
def wrangle(filepath):
    # Read CSV file into DataFrame
    df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    
    #Task 2.1.3
    # Subset to properties in "Capital Federal"
    mask_ba = df['place_with_parent_names'].str.contains("Capital Federal")
    
    # Subset to apartments
    mask_apt = df["property_type"] == "apartment"
    
    # Subset price
    mask_price = df["price_aprox_usd"] < 400_000
    
    df= df[mask_ba & mask_apt & mask_price]

    # Remove outliers by "surface_covered_in_m2"
    low, high = df["surface_covered_in_m2"].quantile([0.1, 0.9])
    mask_area = df["surface_covered_in_m2"].between(low, high)
    df= df[mask_area]

    return df 

#Task 2.1.2: Use your wrangle function to create a DataFrame df from the CSV file data/buenos-aires-real-estate-1.csv.
df = wrangle("data/buenos-aires-real-estate-1.csv")
print("df shape:", df.shape)
df.head()

#Task 2.1.3: Add to your wrangle function (task 2.1.1) so that the DataFrame it returns only includes apartments in Buenos Aires ("Capital Federal") that cost less than $400,000 USD. Then recreate df from data/buenos-aires-real-estate-1.csv by re-running the cells above.
mask_ba = df["place_with_parent_names"].str.contains("Capital Federal")
df[mask_ba].head()

# 1.2 Explore

#Task 2.1.4: Create a histogram of "surface_covered_in_m2". Make sure that the x-axis has the label "Area [sq meters]" and the plot has the title "Distribution of Apartment Sizes".
plt.hist(df["surface_covered_in_m2"])
plt.xlabel("Area [sq meters]")
plt.title("Distribution of Apartment Sizes");

#Task 2.1.5: Calculate the summary statistics for df using the describe method.
df.describe()["surface_covered_in_m2"]

#Task 2.1.6: Add to your wrangle function so that it removes observations that are outliers in the "surface_covered_in_m2" column. Specifically, all observations should fall between the 0.1 and 0.9 quantiles for "surface_covered_in_m2".
low, high = df["surface_covered_in_m2"].quantile([0.1, 0.9])
mask_area = df["surface_covered_in_m2"].between(low, high)
mask_area.head()

#Task 2.1.7: Create a scatter plot that shows price ("price_aprox_usd") vs area ("surface_covered_in_m2") in our dataset. Make sure to label your x-axis "Area [sq meters]" and your y-axis "Price [USD]".
plt.scatter(x=df["surface_covered_in_m2"], y=df["price_aprox_usd"])
plt.xlabel("Area [sq meters]")
plt.ylabel("Price [USD]")
plt.title("Buenos Aires price vs area");

# 1.3 Split

#Task 2.1.8: Create the feature matrix named X_train, which you'll use to train your model. It should contain one feature only: ["surface_covered_in_m2"]. Remember that your feature matrix should always be two-dimensional.

# Feature matrix 2 dimensions-> X, target vector one dimension -> y

features = ["surface_covered_in_m2"]
X_train = df[features]

#Task 2.1.9: Create the target vector named y_train, which you'll use to train your model. Your target should be "price_aprox_usd". Remember that, in most cases, your target vector should be one-dimensional.
target = "price_aprox_usd"
y_train = df[target]


# 2. BUILD MODEL
# Regression problem: target is a continuous value.
# Classification problem:

# 2.1 Baseline

#Task 2.1.10: Calculate the mean of your target vector y_train and assign it to the variable y_mean.
y_mean = y_train.mean()
y_mean

#Task 2.1.11: Create a list named y_pred_baseline that contains the value of y_mean repeated so that it's the same length at y.
y_pred_baseline = [y_mean] * len(y_train)
y_pred_baseline[:5]
len(y_pred_baseline) == len(y_train)

#Task 2.1.12: Add a line to the plot below that shows the relationship between the observations X_train and our dumb model's predictions y_pred_baseline. Be sure that the line color is orange, and that it has the label "Baseline Model".
plt.plot(X_train, y_pred_baseline, color="orange", label ="Baseline Model")
plt.scatter(X_train, y_train)
plt.xlabel("Area [sq meters]")
plt.ylabel("Price [USD]")
plt.title("Buenos Aires: Price vs. Area")
plt.legend();

#Task 2.1.13: Calculate the baseline mean absolute error for your predictions in y_pred_baseline as compared to the true targets in y.
mae_baseline = mean_absolute_error(y_train, y_pred_baseline)

print("Mean apt price", round(y_mean, 2)) #Mean apt price 135527.84
print("Baseline MAE:", round(mae_baseline, 2)) #Baseline MAE: 45199.46

# 2.2 Iterate
# 3 steps to build a model: Instantiate, train and predict.

#Task 2.1.14: Instantiate a LinearRegression model named model.
model = LinearRegression()


#Task 2.1.15: Fit your model to the data, X_train and y_train.
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 2.3 Evaluate
# Task 2.1.16: Using your model's predict method, create a list of predictions for the observations in your feature matrix X_train. Name this array y_pred_training.
y_pred_training = model.predict(X_train)
y_pred_training[:5]

# Task 2.1.17: Calculate your training mean absolute error for your predictions in y_pred_training as compared to the true targets in y_train.
mae_training = mean_absolute_error(y_train, y_pred_training)
print("Training MAE:", round(mae_training, 2))  #Training MAE: 31248.26

#Task 2.1.18: Run the code below to import your test data buenos-aires-test-features.csv into a DataFrame and generate a Series of predictions using your model. Then run the following cell to submit your predictions to the grader.
X_test = pd.read_csv("data/buenos-aires-test-features.csv")[features]
y_pred_test = pd.Series(model.predict(X_test))
y_pred_test.head()

# 3. COMMUNICATE RESULTS
# Once your model is built and tested, it's time to share it with others. If you're presenting to simple linear model to a technical audience, they might appreciate an equation. When we created our baseline model, we represented it as a line. The equation for a line like this is usually written as:
# Equation: y = m*x + b
# Since data scientists often work with more complicated linear models, they prefer to write the equation as:
# Equation: y = beta 0 + beta 1 * x
# Regardless of how we write the equation, we need to find the values that our model has determined for the intercept and and coefficient. Fortunately, all trained models in scikit-learn store this information in the model itself. Let's start with the intercept.

# Task 2.1.19: Extract the intercept from your model, and assign it to the variable intercept.
intercept = round(model.intercept_, 2)
print("Model Intercept:", intercept)
assert any([isinstance(intercept, int), isinstance(intercept, float)])

#Task 2.1.20: Extract the coefficient associated "surface_covered_in_m2" in your model, and assign it to the variable coefficient.
coefficient = round(model.coef_[0], 2)
print('Model coefficient for "surface_covered_in_m2":', coefficient)
assert any([isinstance(coefficient, int), isinstance(coefficient, float)])

#Task 2.1.21: Complete the code below and run the cell to print the equation that your model has determined for predicting apartment price based on size.
print(f"apt-price = {intercept} + {coefficient} * surface_covered")
#apt-price = 11433.31 + 2253.12 * surface_covered

#Task 2.1.22: Add a line to the plot below that shows the relationship between the observations in X_train and your model's predictions y_pred_training. Be sure that the line color is red, and that it has the label "Linear Model".
plt.plot(X_train, model.predict(X_train), color="r", label="Linear Model")
plt.scatter(X_train, y_train)
plt.xlabel("surface covered [sq meters]")
plt.ylabel("price [usd]")
plt.legend();
